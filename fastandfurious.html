                    <h4>FAST AND FURIOUS 9:THE FAST SAGA</h4>
                    <p>Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon.
                        This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most.
                        His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they've ever encountered: 
                        a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob.</p>
